            <p className="text-white text-xl pl-10">Exchange NFTs for other NFTs and crypto</p>
            <p className="text-lg text-white pl-14 pt-5 pr-14">Have you bought an NFT for $200 and want to swap it for other one that costs $50 and let other user to pay you up to total value another $150 in BUSD? With this feature you will be able to trade your NFTs for other NFTs and cryptocurrencies.
            The unique identity and ownership of an NFT is verifiable via the blockchain ledger. They were first launched on the Ethereum(opens in new tab) blockchain, but other blockchains including FLOW and Bitcoin Cash now also support them. Whether the original file is a JPG, MP3, GIF or anything else, the NFT that identifies its ownership can be bought and sold just like any other type of art â€“ and, like with physical art, the price is largely set by market demand.
            If you wandered into a gift shop of an art gallery, you'd find a number of replicated prints of famous masterpieces, well there are some NFTs that act the same way. There are parts of the blockchain that are totally valid, but they wouldn't hold the same value as the original. 
            NFTs will most likely come with a license to the digital asset it points to, but this doesn't automatically confer copyright ownership. The copyright owner may reproduce work and the NFT owner gains no royalties. Artist Chris Petrocchi explains secondary sales and royalties in his video tutorial on how to create NFT art.
